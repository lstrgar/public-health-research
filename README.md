### Good day! Nice to see you here.

This repo contains a single script. It is an example, if you will, of past research work around modeling infectious disease dynamics and disease system interventions. What we are doing here is a simulation of transmission dynamics (encapsulated in a diff-eq model) over a period of time and repeatedly, every N time steps, inserting an modeled intervention into the dynamics. This is done with different kinds of interventions that act on distinct features of the disease system.
